Luffy (LOO-fee) is a fictional character and the protagonist in the Japanese manga series One Piece created by Eiichiro Oda. Luffy made his debut as a young boy who acquires the properties of rubber after accidentally eating one of the Devil Fruits that belonged to Red Hair Shanks.\nMonkey D. Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and dreamt of being a pirate since childhood from the influence of his idol and mentor Red-Haired Shanks. At the age of 17, Luffy sets sail from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger as King of the Pirates.\nHe fights multiple antagonists and aids and befriends the inhabitants of several islands on his journey. Usually cheerful, he becomes serious and even aggressive when he fights. Luffy uses his rubber body to concentrate his power, executing a range of attacks. In his signature attack, the Gum-Gum Pistol, he slingshots punches at opponents from a distance. Luffy also grows stronger over the course of the story by transforming his body through different Gears; this is reflected in his bounty, which is used to measure the threat he poses to the World Government.\nHe is the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, who is a vice-admiral of the Navy; the son of Monkey D. Dragon, who is the leader of the Revolutionary Army; and sworn brother of Portgas D. Ace and Sabo.\nLuffy is usually recognizable by his straw hat, a gift from \"Red-Haired\" Shanks. In his early childhood, he wears a white shirt and blue shorts. The character has a scar under his left eye from stabbing himself to demonstrate his courage to Shanks and his crew. He later wears a red vest, denim shorts, and sandals, before replacing his vest with a red, unbuttoned sea captain's coat revealing the X-shaped scar on his chest he received from Akainu),and a yellow sash tied around his waist.In an interview, Eiichiro Oda said Luffy's real-world nationality analogue is Brazilian.\n\nPersonality:\nLuffy is portrayed as a carefree, fun-loving, happy-go-lucky character with great ambition and a huge appetite, often thinking with his stomach and comically gorging himself. Optimistic and generally good-hearted, he is not as dimwitted as many believe him to be, and he often demonstrates more understanding than the other characters expect. Knowing the danger ahead, Luffy is willing to risk his life to become King of the Pirates and protect his crew. A capable and reliable captain, he never puts his crew or himself at risk out of incompetence. During the Loguetown story arc, Smoker (a navy captain at the time) says that Luffy \"enjoys playing stupid\"; Luffy responds with a mysterious smile.\nHe enlists Chopper and Brook for his crew not just for their personality or appearance, but also because of his instinctive ability to read people. Luffy needs key jobs filled by his crew (cook, navigator, medic, musician, and shipwright, filled by Sanji, Nami, Chopper, Brook, and Franky, respectively). At the beginning of the series, he said that he wanted at least ten crew members with abilities he felt necessary for his goal. Despite his carefree personality, each crew member respects him in their own way. Luffy is rarely concerned about the consequences of his actions, doing what he feels is right at the moment, even if it leads to retaliation by a powerful force. He is an extremely loyal captain, who has demonstrated throughout the series that he is willing to risk his life for the well-being of his crew. He hates vegetarian food and prefers meat over anything unless you're talking about the one piece.\n\nAbilities:\nDevil Fruit\n Luffy's rubber attributes are a result of eating a devil fruit called the Human-Human fruit model Sun God Nika. This devil fruit is thought to be called the Gum-Gum fruit due to world government propaganda. Granting him a rubber-like body, his powers make him immune to electric attacks and most blunt forces, but he is susceptible to sharp object or weapon attacks (e.g., sword, spear). His rubber powers grant him the ability to stretch his body at will. He uses his elasticity to accelerate his body to deliver punches, kicks, headbutts, and other varied attacks. Like others who have eaten a devil fruit, Luffy cannot swim; when submerged in water or contacting Sea-Prism Stone, he loses strength and cannot move.\nIn addition to his devil fruit powers, he has immense strength, durability, speed, reflexes, agility, endurance, and stamina. Luffy's signature attack is the Gum-Gum Pistol, a punch he learned during years of training. Another technique developed later is Gear 2, which increases his strength and speed for a short time but strains his body and can shorten his lifespan. Observing CP9's Shave technique, Luffy adapts it to his rubber body, making his arms or legs bigger. Gear 3 uses air in his bones to attack but makes him shrink afterward. Luffy can use both techniques simultaneously; after a two-year time skip, he gains better control of these techniques and is no longer affected by their drawbacks.\nLuffy develops Gear 4, inflating his muscles with air to increase his body's size (except his legs), coating his limbs in Armament Haki. Unlike Gears 2 and 3, Luffy uses compression rather than extension, compressing and releasing his limbs to deliver devastating blows. The force of his kicks allows him to fly similarly to CP9's Moon Walk technique.\nLater, it is revealed that the Gum-Gum Fruit's real name is the Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika, a Mythical Zoan-type devil fruit. Its \"awakening\" grants Luffy's rubber-like body increased strength and freedom, including turning the environment and living beings into rubber, limited only by imagination. The user becomes a trickster sun god known as the \"embodiment of freedom,\" bringing joy to people and making it \"the most ridiculous power in the world.\" In Gear 5, Luffy's hair and clothes turn white. The World Government renamed it to conceal its true nature and reclassified it as a Paramecia. The fruit was a treasure sought by the World Government for 800 years until stolen by Red-haired Shanks. The fruit had not awakened for centuries before Luffy.\nHaki\n Luffy has the ability to use Haki, which has three types: Armament Haki, an armor-like force that amplifies defense and attacks, negating a devil fruit user's defense and allowing physical contact; Observation Haki, a sixth sense that reads moves and detects presence; and Conqueror's Haki, which renders weak-willed people or animals unconscious. Luffy learns all three types and uses them with his attacks. After his encounter with Magellan, he developed immunity to poison, though strong poisons may affect him slowly.\nDuring his fight against Charlotte Katakuri, Luffy gains an advanced form of Observation Haki, called Future Sight, to see seconds into the future. At Udon prison in Wano, he gains two advanced forms of Armament Haki: Emission, to shoot a short blast of Haki from a distance, and Internal Destruction, to destroy targets from within. During his fight with Kaidou on Onigashima, Luffy unlocks an advanced form of Conqueror's Haki, coating his body with it to enhance his attacks.\n\nBounty:\nThroughout One Piece, the bounty placed on Luffy continually increases as he faces off against increasingly powerful pirates, representing his notoriety in the One Piece world. After defeating Buggy, Don Krieg, and Arlong of East Blue, early on in the series, Luffy's initial bounty is set to 30,000,000 Berries. By the major timeskip in One Piece, this number had increased to 400,000,000 Berries after defeating some of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, rampaging at Enies Lobby, and retaking Nico Robin. In current arcs, Luffy's total bounty has increased to 3 billion Berries after becoming one of the \"Four Emperors in the New World.\"\n\nShort Story:\nLuffy first appears as a young boy in Windmill Village located in the Goa kingdom, where he befriends the pirate \"Red-Haired\" Shanks and intends to become one himself. He accidentally eats the Gum-Gum Devil Fruit and acquires rubber powers at the cost of being unable to swim. Shanks later saves Luffy from being devoured by a Sea King, a monstrous sea beast, at the cost of his left arm. Before departing Windmill Village, Shanks gives Luffy his treasured straw hat, on the condition that he becomes a great pirate someday and returns it to him. Ten years later, Luffy leaves the village in a small fishing boat in search of the legendary treasure 'One Piece' to become the next King of the Pirates. He meets swordsman Roronoa Zoro, ocean navigator and thief Nami, cowardly marksman and liar Usopp, and chivalrous chef Sanji and invites them to join his crew, while procuring a ship named the Going Merry Luffy also encounters and defeats the top East Blue pirates Buggy the Clown, Don Krieg and the Fishman Arlong, gaining his first bounty from the Marines.\nThe crew enters the dangerous Grand Line on their ship, the Going Merry. Luffy encounters and offers to return Princess Nefertari Vivi of Alabasta to her homeland to stop a rebellion incited by Seven Warlords of the Sea member and Baroque Works crime syndicate leader Sir Crocodile. On the way, Nami contracts a severe illness and the crew goes to find a doctor on the winter Drum Island. After Nami is healed, the reindeer doctor Tony Tony Chopper joins the Straw Hat crew. Upon arriving in Alabasta, Luffy briefly reunites with his brother Portgas D. Ace, a commander in the Whitebeard Pirates, who is hunting the traitor Blackbeard. Luffy defeats Crocodile, though the World Government censors his involvement. Luffy then accepts Crocodile's mysterious partner Nico Robin as the archeologist of his crew.\nRobin's knowledge alerts the crew to the existence of Sky Islands. Luffy meets Blackbeard — but does not find out his name. Blackbeard encourages Luffy to find the Sky Island, saying that the dreams of pirates never die. The crew successfully reaches Skypiea, where the crew is drawn into a four-hundred-year war over land. Luffy ends the war by defeating the god Eneru.\nUpon landing back in the Blue Seas, the Going Merry is heavily damaged and Luffy seeks a shipwright to repair it. He meets Marine Admiral Aokiji, who easily defeats him but allows the crew to continue their voyage. The crew arrives at Water 7, the island with the best shipwrights in the world, where Robin mysteriously leaves with members of the World Government intelligence agency Cipher Pol No. 9. Luffy's crew aligns with the cyborg shipwright Franky, initially an enemy, and storm the Government's courthouse Enies Lobby to retrieve her. Robin reveals her past as a fugitive of the Government, but the Straw Hats declare war on the Government to affirm their commitment to her. After defeating CP9 and escaping Enies Lobby, Luffy encounters his grandfather, Vice Admiral Monkey D. Garp. Garp tells him Shanks and Whitebeard are two of the Four Emperors, the most powerful pirates in the second half of the Grand Line. Luffy is surprised to learn from Garp that the leader of the Revolutionary Army which seeks to topple the World Government is Monkey D. Dragon, Luffy's father.\nOn the way to Fishman Island in their new ship, the Thousand Sunny, which Franky built, Luffy encounters the skeletal musician Brook. Brook accepts Luffy's offer to join the crew before declining since his shadow has been stolen. To return Brook's shadow, they defeat Warlord Gecko Moria, and Brook becomes Luffy's long-sought musician of the crew.\nTo enter Fishman Island, the crew takes a detour to the Sabaody Archipelago. By this time, Luffy has gained worldwide fame among the notorious rookie pirates with bounties of over 100 million Berries; these rookies are known as Supernovas and include Zoro, Trafalgar Law, Eustass Kidd, and Capone \"Gang\" Bege. The Roger Pirates' retired First Mate, Silvers Rayleigh, takes a liking to Luffy and agrees to coat the Thousand Sunny to sail into the ocean depths. However, the plan is derailed after Luffy attacks a World Noble for harming a friend, and the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates are easily defeated by Admiral Kizaru and scattered to different parts of the world by Warlord Bartholomew Kuma.\nStranded on Amazon Lily, an island ruled by the warlord Boa Hancock, Luffy impresses her with his bravery and selflessness. While on Amazon Lily, Luffy learns that his brother Ace was defeated by Blackbeard and handed over to the World Government for execution. Hancock helps him infiltrate the underwater prison Impel Down to rescue Ace. Inside he meets previous foes and new allies, such as former Warlords Crocodile and Arlong's old captain Jimbei. Along with Buggy and members of the Revolutionary Army, Luffy frees the prisoners, but Ace is transferred to Marineford for his execution. Luffy and Buggy lead the prisoners into the war in Marineford between the navy and Whitebeard's forces. Whitebeard is eventually impressed by Luffy's spirit and orders his men to support Luffy directly. Although Ace is freed, he gives his life to save Luffy from Admiral Akainu. A broken-hearted Luffy is evacuated with Jimbei from Marineford by Trafalgar Law.\nReturning to Amazon Lily, Luffy remembers first meeting Ace; after Shanks left Windmill Village, Luffy's grandfather Garp left him in the care of his friend, the bandit Curly Dadan. Luffy befriends Ace and Sabo, who are like brothers to him, but Sabo is seemingly killed by a World Noble. After returning to Marineford to send a hidden message to his crew, Luffy trains with Rayleigh on Ruskaina Island to learn Haki.\nTwo years later, the Straw Hats reunite and finally make it to Fishman Island. Luffy and the others meet Jimbei and the island's princess, Shirahoshi, and are drawn into a battle for the island against the Fishman supremacist Hody Jones. He, the crew, and Jimbei conceive a plan to defeat Hody and his henchmen in a way that will alleviate racial tensions between humans and fish-men. After Hody's defeat, Jimbei promises to join the crew at a later date and Fishman Island seeks to join the Reverie summit of human kings, held every four years. Luffy learns Akainu was promoted to Fleet Admiral and Blackbeard replaced Whitebeard as one of the Four Emperors. Luffy begins a feud with Emperor Big Mom over control of Fishman Island. The crew leaves the ocean depths and enters the secret New World island, Punk Hazard.\nUpon arriving at Punk Hazard, half of the crew is captured by Caesar Clown, a subordinate of the Warlord and underworld broker Donquixote Doflamingo. Luffy and his crew ally with Trafalgar Law, now a Warlord, who plans to kidnap Caesar as part of a plan to take down Doflamingo and eventually his customer, Emperor Kaido. Samurai from the Wano Country, Kinemon, and Momonosuke join the alliance to venture to Dressrosa, the kingdom ruled by Doflamingo.\nWith Caesar hostage, the alliance lands on Dressrosa, where Luffy enters a tournament to win Ace's Devil Fruit. Here he finds out that Sabo is still alive and is part of the Revolutionary Army. Sabo wins the tournament, and with Luffy's blessing, Sabo consumes Ace's Devil Fruit. Due to the machinations of Doflamingo, some of the crew is forced to leave for the island of Zou. Luffy and the rest of the crew are forced to fight for their lives when they stumble on the truth of Doflamingo's operations, who attempts to kill everyone in Dressrosa to keep the truth of his rule hidden. With the aid of his fellow competitors in the tournament, Luffy defeats Doflamingo. In the aftermath, seven pirate crews pledge their loyalty to Luffy, despite his protests, marking the formation of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.\nAfterward, the remaining crew and their friends arrive at Zou and learn it was devastated by Kaido's army. Luffy also learns that Sanji, who joined the first group to Zou, had been blackmailed by his family into an arranged marriage to the daughter of Emperor Big Mom. The crew learns from the Mink Tribe about the Road Poneglyphs and their connection to the final island Laugh Tale, where the One Piece is. An alliance between the Samurai, Mink, Straw Hats and Law is made to defeat Kaido, who rules over Wano via a puppet Shogun.\nBefore storming Wano, half the crew, along with the Mink warriors Pedro and Carrot, infiltrate Big Mom's territory Tottoland both to retrieve Sanji and copy the writing on the Road Poneglyph that Big Mom has in her possession. Luffy and Sanji learn the wedding is a set-up to murder Sanji's family and steal their advanced technology, while Brook steals a printing of the Road Poneglyph. The crew reunites with Jimbei, revealed to be indebted to Big Mom but intent on defecting to Luffy's crew. They ally with Capone Bege to assassinate Big Mom at the wedding, though the plan goes awry. As the crew attempts to escape, Luffy defeats her general Charlotte Katakuri, discovering an advanced application of Observation Haki in the process. Jimbei formally joins the crew, but stays behind to aid his former Fishman crewmates in holding off the Big Mom Pirates as Luffy's crew escapes.\nNews of Luffy's fight with Big Mom and the reveal of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet cause Luffy's bounty to skyrocket. Meanwhile, the Straw Hats are separated entering the Wano Country. Luffy befriends the residents and promises to improve their lives. After Kaido attacks his friend Tama, Luffy challenges the Emperor but is defeated and thrown in prison. There, he re-encounters Eustass Kid and trains under Hyogoro of the Flower, learning a new form of Armament Haki that will enable him to damage Kaido. Luffy's allies liberate the prison and makes plans to attack the island of Onigashima where Kaido resides. Jimbei arrives in Wano, and on the night of Wano's annual Fire Festival, an alliance of the Straw Hat, Heart and Kid pirates, the retainers of Kozuki Oden and an army of Samurai, launch a raid on Onigashima. Luffy faces Kaido across several bouts that push him to his limits. The Five Elders send CP0 to interfere with the fight, fearing the repercussions of Luffy winning. Despite suffering an apparently fatal blow from Kaido as a result, the thrill triggers the awakening of Luffy's Devil Fruit—now revealed to be the mythical Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika. In his new transformation, dubbed \"Gear Fifth\", Luffy can fight in any shape he likes and successfully overwhelms Kaido, liberating Wano from his rule. A week after these events, Luffy is pronounced a new member of the Four Emperors.\nAfter departing Wano, the Straw Hats reach the island of Egghead where the World Government's lead scientist Dr. Vegapunk resides. Jewelry Bonney also arrives, seeking to avenge her father Kuma's transformation into a cyborg by Vegapunk Vegapunk admits to having studied the forbidden Void Century and requests that the Straw Hats help him escape an assassination attempt by CP0. The situation escalates when CP0 informs the Government of Luffy's presence, and St. Jaygarcia Saturn arrives personally to eliminate him, accompanied by Kizaru.\n\n\n\n\nFunniest dialogs:\n\"Hero?
